Generalized maps for the Go Programming Language: 
------------------------------------------------

- These containers aim at storing aggregate types.
- These maps accept as keys all interfaces which implement a Key() method (or a String() or an Int() method respectively), see example maps_test.go.
thereby generalizing the Go built-in map type to aggregate types.
